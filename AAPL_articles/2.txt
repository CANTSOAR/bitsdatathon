In This Article:    AAPL   +1.91%     We recently published a list of Couch Potato Stock Portfolio: 7 Best Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best stocks to invest in from Couch Potato portfolio. Couch Potato investing is the concept of having a portfolio of assets that operate almost entirely on autopilot. This portfolio is intended to withstand shifting market circumstances without needing investors to make major modifications to their asset allocation or objectives. In 1991, Scott Burns came up with the idea, seeking to construct the simplest investment strategy possible: a 50/50 combination of equities and bonds using only two funds. Burns claims that this makes it possibly the most accessible portfolio available, stating that anyone who “can divide by 2” can understand it.   Barclays calculated the weighted average returns of hedge fund portfolios by investor type, which ranged from 10% to 11%. Based on performance, a conventional 60/40 portfolio model would have comfortably outperformed these gains. According to the Lazy Portfolio ETF, a 60% stock/40% bond strategy incorporating the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the Total Bond Market Index Fund would have returned little less than 15% in 2024. Even after 5 years, including 2022, when both stocks and bonds fell in value, the 60/40 method has an average return of 8%. In essence, couch potato investing is a more conservative version of the 60/40 method. More importantly, its dependability shines through in difficult circumstances. For example, between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 sank 43.1%, whereas the couch potato portfolio declined just 6.3%. Unsurprisingly, one possible downside of the couch potato portfolio is that it tends to underperform during notable market upswings. Portfolios with a larger allocation to equities can better capitalize on bullish markets, resulting in higher returns than the more conservative couch potato strategy. This disparity is especially prominent when the proportion of shares in a portfolio exceeds the couch potato approach’s balanced 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds. However, Burns recommends that investors evaluate this strategy comprehensively. “Your 35-year portfolio, for instance, was worth $884,481 at the end of 2021 and declined $155,601 during 2022. That’s a loss greater than the original $100,000 value.   Story Continues   Our Methodology Although couch potato investing discourages individual stock trading in favor of index investment, we chose to examine the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and identified some of its best holdings for this list. These equities were then filtered down further based on many parameters, including the hedge fund sentiment around them, a history of stable dividend payments, and well-established businesses.
